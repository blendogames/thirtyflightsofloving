vertex lights become dark after map transition (vid_restart fixes)
	- FIXED, caused by allocating 0x800000 max size for md2 models
	
crash on darksun1.bsp when vertexlight/vertexlightbase fields not properly allocated (Hunk_Alloc problem?)
	- FIXED, caused by allocating same size for each poly in a surface

crashes when loading a game that has a target_text box open

	- FIXED by clearing looped sound for all cases in door_hit_top()/door_hit_bottom() and plat_hit_top()/plat_hit_bottom()
	
fatal error when loading too many md2 models (VirtualAlloc reserve failure)
	- FIXED by implementing new ModChunk_ memory allocation system for models

	- FIXED by allowing CS_STATUSBAR to overflow thru CS_AIRACCEL-1

Thirdperson player shadow not drawn correctly at times (start of hangar1)
